# Exercise 1 - Closures 
Try to write your first `closure`. Write a function called `printName` and declare inside it a variable called `helloName`, the value of this variable will be: "Hello John". 
Also declare a function named `inner` and return the helloName variable. The purpose is printing "Hello John" in the console.

# Exercise 2 - Closures 
Starting from the previous exercise, are you able to print the value of helloName, `after 1 second`?

# Exercise 3 - Closures 
Write a new closure: create a function called `multiplyByTwo` that takes in one parameter. Inside the multiplyByTwo function, create a function called `inner`. 
This function will take care of multiplying the parameter passed as input and multiply it by the variable named `number`. Print in the console the function output.
