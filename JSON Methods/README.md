# Exercise 1 - JSON Methods

Convert the `developer` object into JSON

# Exercise 2 - JSON Methods

Create the fromJson method that takes in a json as parameter and returns an object of type `Person`.

# Exercise 3 - JSON Methods

In this exercises something goes wrong. Even though we have created a copy of `person1`, 
modifying the property city of `person2` changes even the value for person1. This happens because we have created a shallow copy. 
How we can fix the code, in order to modify the values of person2 without changing the one of person1?

# Exercise 4 - JSON Methods

In this exercise we need to filter the properties of the object `person` in order to convert into JSON just the values of id and age.
