# Exercise 1 - Callbacks

Write a function called `printAsyncName`, which will take as parameters a callback and a string (which will be name). The callback function will simply print "Hello". 
The printAsyncName function will have to execute the callback function after an interval of 1 second. 
After an interval of 2 seconds, we must print the name that we take as a parameter.

# Exercise 2 - Callbacks

Write a function called `repeatHello`, which will take as parameter a callback. The callback function will simply print "Hello". The repeatHello function will have to execute the callback function with an interval of 1 second. 

# Exercise 3 - Callbacks

Starting from the previous exercise, we want to add to our function repeatHello, a clearInterval after 5 seconds, could you do that?
